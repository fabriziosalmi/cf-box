## IP List Manager
IP List Manager is a tool that automates tasks the synchronization of [IP lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) across multiple Cloudflare accounts. It is designed to help Cloudflare users efficiently manage allowlists, blocklists, and trusted IP ranges.

```
cf-box % python3 cloudflare_ip_list_manager.py
ðŸ“Œ Managing IP lists for -- REDACTED -- Account (ID: -- REDACTED --)
âœ… Fetched 8491 IPs from https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/raw/refs/heads/master/levels/3.txt
âœ… Successfully updated IP list 3f2ce1bd8ff3479d8d86367257f8d15c with 8491 entries
```

> [!WARNING]
> Set your GitHub repository visibility to **private** before to populate config.yaml and execute the runner. Note that you can store zone ids as GitHub Actions secrets. You can also woould like to remove the -u option in the workflow to remove sensitive data in debug logs.

## Features
- âœ… **Automatic IP list synchronization** with Cloudflare's API.
- âœ… **Supports multiple accounts and IP lists** via a YAML configuration.
- âœ… **Fetches IPs from external sources** (JSON and plaintext).
- âœ… **Caches IP lists locally** to avoid unnecessary API requests.
- âœ… **Optimized bulk update** to avoid multiple requests for rulesets endpoints.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `requests`
- `pyyaml`

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
The script uses a `config.yaml` file to define accounts, IP lists, and sources.

### Example `config.yaml`
```yaml
accounts:
  - id: "1e7ed1e7e9b2dfdfb15ed609d30fbe52"
    name: "Example Cloudflare Account"
    lists:
      - name: "trusted_aws_ips"
        sync_from: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lord-alfred/ipranges/main/aws.json"
        type: "json"
      - name: "bad_ips"
        sync_from: "https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum/raw/refs/heads/master/levels/3.txt"
        type: "text"
    notifications:
      webhook: "https://your-webhook-url.com"
```

## Usage
### Set API Token
Ensure your Cloudflare API token is set as an environment variable or as GitHub Actions Repository Secret:
```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_cloudflare_api_token"
```

### Run the Script
```sh
python cloudflare_ip_list_manager.py
```

## How It Works
1. **Reads the `config.yaml`** for accounts and IP list definitions.
2. **Fetches the current Cloudflare IP lists** to compare with external sources.
3. **Downloads IPs from the specified sources** (JSON or plaintext files).
4. **Checks for changes** to avoid unnecessary API updates.
5. **Bulk updates Cloudflare IP lists** to comply with rate limits.
6. **Caches results** to minimize external requests.

## Cloudflare API Rate Limit Handling
- **Cloudflare limits API requests** to ~1,200 per 5 minutes per account.
- The script **uses a [single bulk update](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/#limits) instead of multiple small updates**.
- Implements **300-600s backoff when rate-limited**.
